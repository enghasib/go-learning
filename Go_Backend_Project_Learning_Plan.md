# 🛠️ Project-Based Learning Plan for Go Backend Engineering

---

## 🔰 1. Go Fundamentals
**Goal:** Understand syntax, control flow, and Go's type system.

### 🧪 Mini Projects:
- ✅ CLI Calculator (use structs & functions)
- ✅ To-Do CLI App (use slices, maps, structs)

---

## ⚙️ 2. Standard Library & Tooling
**Goal:** Use Go’s built-in packages and master tooling.

### 🧪 Mini Projects:
- ✅ File Reader CLI (read and parse text files)
- ✅ JSON Parser (unmarshal JSON files into structs)
- ✅ Logger Utility (write structured logs to file)

---

## 🌐 3. Web Development with Go
**Goal:** Build basic REST APIs using `net/http` or a framework (Gin).

### 🧪 Projects:
- ✅ User Management API (CRUD with in-memory storage)
- ✅ Middleware-based Auth (JWT or session-based)
- ✅ Blog API (routes, query params, and data structs)

---

## 🗃️ 4. Database Integration
**Goal:** Connect your API to a real database.

### 🧪 Projects:
- ✅ Blog API with PostgreSQL (GORM or `database/sql`)
- ✅ Expense Tracker (CRUD + filtering)
- ✅ Forum Backend (one-to-many, pagination)

---

## 💻 5. Advanced Concepts
**Goal:** Learn concurrency, context, error handling.

### 🧪 Projects:
- ✅ Concurrent Web Scraper (goroutines + channels)
- ✅ Rate Limiter Middleware (goroutines + time)
- ✅ Email Queue System (workers + channels)

---

## 🧪 6. Testing & Optimization
**Goal:** Practice unit tests, benchmarks, profiling.

### 🧪 Projects:
- ✅ Test blog API endpoints using `httptest`
- ✅ Benchmark a sorting algorithm
- ✅ Profile memory usage of a data processor

---

## 🚀 7. Deployable Projects
**Goal:** Complete production-ready applications.

### 🧪 Projects:
- ✅ URL Shortener (with Redis/MySQL)
- ✅ Real-time Chat Server (WebSocket + goroutines)
- ✅ Task Queue Service (with RabbitMQ or Redis)
- ✅ E-commerce REST API (full-stack backend)

---

## ☁️ 8. DevOps & Deployment
**Goal:** Learn CI/CD, Docker, and cloud deployment.

### 🧪 Projects:
- ✅ Dockerized Go API with PostgreSQL
- ✅ GitHub Actions for Go test/build
- ✅ Deploy blog API on Render or Railway
- ✅ Add logging and monitoring with Promtail + Grafana
